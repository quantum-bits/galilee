Scripture Engagement Application: Server

== Create a Database

Create a Postgres database as follows:

* Name: `galilee`
* User: `galilee`
* Password: `pass`

If these values are not to your liking,
update the contents of `knexfile.js`
to correspond to your preferences.

== Create the Schema

From the command line, run

   npm run knex:migrate

This should create all the database tables
in the current version of the software.

== Load Fixture Data

From the command line, run

   npm run knex:seed

This should add sample data to the database.

== Run the Server

Run the `start` command from `package.json` as follows

   npm start

You can also run a `nodemon` server,
which will restart the server when any source file changes

   npm run watch

== Run Tests

To run the complete test suite

   npm test
