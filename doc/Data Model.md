## Definitions

We use the following terms with specific intent.

* **Reading**
  Scripture passage around which everything orbits.
* **Practice**
  Shorthand for _Scripture Engagement Practice_
* **Step** 
  Guidance about how to apply a practice to a reading
* **Media**
  Image, audio, or video.

Comments

* __Media__ is what we had been referring to as a _resource_,
  which could be more generic than image, audio, or video.
  Phil clarified that only these three types of resources
  are used in the actual content,
  so we don't need to be more generic.

## Details

* A __reading__ contains one or more contiguous ranges of verses
  (e.g., _Matthew 5.1-12_ or _Luke 2.1-5, 9-11_)
* A __reading__ has one or more associated __practices__.
* A __practice__ comprises
  1. A __summary__ of the practice that can serve as a _quick_,
     generic reminder of what the practice entails;
     not tied to a specific reading;
     displayed to the user as an introductory
     page when they choose a practice for a reading;
     user can instruct the system to
     skip this page on a per-practice basis.
  2. A __description__ of the practice that goes into more detail;
     corresponds basically to the static descriptions of
     practices currently on Bible Gateway;
