- [[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units][Systemctl Tutorial (Digital Ocean)]]
** Debugging
1. Use the log file:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   tail -f /var/lib/pgsql/9.6/data/pg_log/postgresql-Thu.log
   #+END_EXAMPLE
** Postgres.App (Mac)
*** Data directory
- =~/Library/Application Support/Posgres/var-9.5=
**** =postgresql.conf=
- I have fiddled with timezone parameters;
  I don't know that this is right
  - ~timezone = 'UTC'~
  - ~log_timezone = 'US/Eastern'~
- The =listen_addresses= parameter is set to it's default (=localhost=)
**** =pg_hba.conf=
- =hba= = "host-based authentication"
- Uses =trust= method for all local connections and for =127.0.0.1/32=
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             all                                     trust
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
#+END_EXAMPLE
- =local=: connection attempts using Unix-domain sockets
- =host=: connection attempts made using TCP/IP (SSL or non-SSL)
- =trust=: allow the connection unconditionally
**** =pg_ident.conf=
- Factory defaults
** Postgres 9.6 (=galilee=)
- OS: CentOS 7
*** Data Directory
**** =/var/lib/pgsql/9.6/data=
- Time zone was set to =US/East-Indiana= at install time;
  I did not set this. Was it determined by inspecting CentOS?
- =listen_address= also set to default (=localhost=)
**** =pg_hba.conf=
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             all                                     peer
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident
host    all             all             ::1/128                 ident
#+END_EXAMPLE
- =peer=: obtain the client's OS user name and check if it matches the
  requested database user name; only available for local connections
- =ident=: obtain the OS user name of the client by contacting the ident server
  (e.g., =identd=) on the client and check if it matches the requested database
  user name.  Only on TCP/IP connections. When specified for local connections,
  peer authentication used instead.
**** =pg_ident.conf=
- Factory defaults
** Commands
- Determine location of important files in the file system:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  SELECT name, setting
  FROM pg_settings
  WHERE category = 'File Locations';
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- Show information about database roles; from the pgsql documentation
  on =rolpassword=: password (possibly encrypted); null if none.
  If the password is encrypted, begin with =md5=
  followed by a 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  SELECT *
  FROM pg_authid;
  #+END_EXAMPLE
** Setting up PGSQL for =galilee= User

Ran the following commands as normal user (=tnurkkala=)
- =sudo -u postgres createuser --login --pwprompt galilee=
  1. =--login= allows login
  2. =--pwprompt= issues prompt for new user's password
- =sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=galilee galilee=
- =sudo systemctl restart postgresql-9.6=
- Added these lines to the =pg_hba.conf= file:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # TYPE  DATABASE    USER       ADDRESS      METHOD
  # [nurk 2017-02-16]
  local   galilee     galilee                 md5
  host    galilee     galilee    localhost    md5
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  Note that these /must/ go before the default entries in =pg_hba=;
  permissions are processed /in file order/.
  The first line allows the =galilee= user to connect from the =galilee= host
  using password authentication.
  The second line allows a network connection using ssh port forwarding
  with a password. The forwarded port shows up at address =localhost=.
  Here are the relevant lines from =~/.ssh/config=:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Host galilee-proxy
    HostName        galilee.cse.taylor.edu
    ProxyJump       john
    LocalForward    5434    localhost:5432
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  Note that the local port is different from the standard PGSQL port
  because I'm probably also running PGSQL on my local machine.
- =psql --username=galilee --password=
  1. Can be run as any user (e.g., =tnurkkala=)
* Network Information
| Host                   | IP               |                   |
|------------------------+------------------+-------------------|
| john.cse.taylor.edu    | 10.120.1.24/16   | 192.195.249.24/24 |
| galilee.cse.taylor.edu | 10.120.160.40/16 | 192.195.249.57/24 |
- When I connect from my Mac at home, I show up on =john= as =68.45.120.149=,
  which must be my IP address assigned by Comcast
- When I =ssh= to =john= and /then/ to =galilee=,
  my IP addres (reported by =who=) is =10.120.1.24= (IP address for =john=).
  Same deal with =ssh= via =galilee-proxy=, which uses =ProxyJump= through =john=.
