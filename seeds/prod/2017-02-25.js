                                 It reads, "Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."
                                 This verse is helpful because it is a specific instruction 
                                 and tells the reader about the Lord's character at the same time. 
                                 Serving the Lord with fear is necessary because He is Holy, 
                                 and rejoicing in the Lord with trembling is noteworthy. 
                                 
                                 Begin with this verse, and continue by memorizing more of the passage,
