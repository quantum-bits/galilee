# Dramatizing Scripture

So often there is something memorable and moving about watching a story unfold
that is being dramatized before us. With a bit of creativity, Scripture stories
can come alive before peopleâ€™s eyes. We tend to put ourselves into good stories
that are acted well, "trying on" what characters are thinking and feeling,
often seeing ourselves and the world in a new way. Dramatizing Scripture can
help us to engage both our minds and emotions. We want to encourage you to
consider actually acting out parts of Scripture and we have given you some
ssuggestions as to how you could proceed with today's passage.
