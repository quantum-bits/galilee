# Storying Scripture

In storying, a teacher tells a Bible story by memory to a group of people. The
listeners then retell the story together back to the teacher as best as they
can. The teacher than tells the story again until all of the listeners have the
story in their memory. The group then discusses the story and relates their own
lives to the story. The goal is for the listeners to learn the story so they
can share it with others, in a sense, becoming walking, talking Bibles.
Storying is a particularly powerful means of engaging Scripture in a small
group setting. Storying cultivates interaction among the group members as they
come together to try to retell the story.
