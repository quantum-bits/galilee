# Scripture Engagement Through Visual Art

Images connect with our emotions and can convey deep truths. Images can be
powerful triggers to help us remember the stories and connect with the truths
of the Bible. A good piece of biblical art can as give us "fresh eyes" for
familiar passages. The artist becomes our companion who points out details of a
passage that we might have passed over in haste. Since art is often complicated
and takes time to understand, it requires us to slow down and helps us to
meditate on a passage. In the presence of the Holy Spirit, the believer
combines the resource of art and the inspired words of the Bible, allowing
him/her to encounter the God of the Bible in a new way.
