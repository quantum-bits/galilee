{ "title": "Speaking Scripture", "id": 12 }

We are created for community and wired to speak with others. The things in our
lives that are on our heart naturally come out in our conversation, and the
conversations we have with others result in our turning those ideas over in our
minds (in other words, what we talk about often leads to what we think/meditate
about). By speaking about Scripture with other people we deepen our connection
with Godâ€™s Word. A consistent theme in the Bible is that God tells us to speak
to others about what he has said to us. We aren't to keep his Word to
ourselves. Instead, his Word is to be on our lips and we are to speak Scripture
to one another.
