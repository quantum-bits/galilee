{ "title": "Hand Copying Scripture" }

Hand copying Scripture is simply writing out word-for-word passages of
Scripture by hand.  Writing the Bible out by hand offers us the unique
opportunity to participate in an activity that forces us to slow down the
process of reading and encourages a more reflective engagement with Godâ€™s Word.
It gives us more time to think about what is written and to dwell on the
meaning and implications of a passage.  Hand copying is a focusing activity.
Hand copying helps combat quick, surface level reading.  Copying is an aid to
memory and also helps us to perceive details in a passage that might have been
overlooked.
