{ "title": "Praying Scripture" }

Engaging the Bible and praying are the primary methods for developing a
deepening relationship with God. While many tend to think of prayer and Bible
reading as separate spiritual practices (e.g., first I pray, then I read the
Bible), they can be even more powerful when combined into one practice of
"praying scripture." Your confidence in your prayers will be strengthened when
you pray Godâ€™s Words. Praying the Scriptures allows you to use the words and
emotions of the Bible to gain more confidence in your prayers. Praying
Scripture can mean either praying the prayers of the Bible word-for-word as
your own prayers, personalizing portions of the Scriptures in prayer, or
praying through various topics of the Bible. Suggestions for praying today's
passage will be given in this section.
